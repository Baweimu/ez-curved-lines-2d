# Scalable Vector Shapes 2D plugin for Godot 4.4

Scalable Vector Shapes 2D lets you do 2 things:
1. Draw seamless vector shapes using a Path Editor inspired by the awesome [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
2. Import [.svg](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/) files as seamless vector shapes in stead of as raster images

*__Important sidenote__: _This plugin only supports a small - yet relevant - subset of the huge [SVG Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html)_

## Looking for EZ Curved Lines 2D?
The renamed plugin deprecates the old `DrawablePath2D` custom node in favor of `ScalableVectorShape2D`. A Conversion button is provided:

![converter button](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/00-converter.png)

The reason is that `ScalableVectorShape2D` inherits directly from `Node2D` giving much more control to the plugin over how you can draw.

# Drawing Shapes in the Godot 2D Viewport

After activating this plugin a new bottom panel item appears, called "Scalable Vector Graphics".

There are 3 ways to start drawing:
1. [Add a `ScalableVectorShape2D` node to your scene](#adding-a-scalablevectorshape2d-node-to-your-scene)
2.  [Generating a Circle or Rectangle using the bottom panel item](#generating-a-circle-or-rectangle-using-the-bottom-panel-item)
3.  [Using the `.svg` importer](#using-the-svg-importer)

## Adding a `ScalableVectorShape2D` node to your scene

This works exactly the same way as adding a normal godot node, using `Ctrl-A` or using right-click inside the 2D viewport and choosing `Add Node here`:

![create node](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/02-create-node.png)

### Double click to add points

Once you added your new node, a hint should suggest you add points using double click (as long as you're in edit mode):

![add node double click](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/03-double-click.png)


### Adding a `Line2D` as stroke and a `Polygon2D` as fill

After adding at least 2 points you can use the `Inspector` panel to generate a `Line2D` and/or a `Polygon2D` to serve as stroke and fill:

![add stroke and fill](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/04-generate.png)

[Skip to further reading about manipulating shapes](#manipulating-shapes)

### More about assigned `Line2D`, `Polygon2D` and `CollisionPolygon2D`

Using the `Generate ...` buttons in the inspector simply adds a new node as a child to `ScalableVectorShape2D` but it does __not need to be__ a child. The important bit is that the new node is _assigned_ to it via its properties: `polygon`, `line` and `collision_polygon`:

#### The assigned shapes are now siblings

![assigned tree](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/12a-assigned.png)

#### Yet they still respond to changes to your `ScalableVectorShape2D`

![assigned viewport](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/12b-assigned.png)

#### Because you assigned them to it using the inspector

![assigned inspector](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/12c-assigned.png)

## Generating a Circle, Ellipse or Rectangle using the bottom panel item

It's probably easier to start out with a basic primitive shape (like you would in Inkscape <3)

The second tab in the `Scalable Vector Shapes` panel gives you some basic choices:

![the bottom panel](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/06-scalable-vector-shapes-panel.png)

This youtube short shows what adding a circle looks like:

[![thumb](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/yt_short_thumb.png)](https://youtu.be/WdXfcnx-I9w?feature=shared&t=41)

## Using the `.svg` importer

As mentioned in the introduction, the `.svg` import supports a small - _yet relevant_ - subset of the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/).

That being said, it's still pretty cool and serves my purposes quite well. You can drag any `.svg` resource file into the first tab of the bottom dock to see if it works for you too:

![svg importer dock](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/13-svg-importer-dock.png)

On the left side of this panel is a form with a couple of options you can experiment with. On the right side is an import log, which will show warnings of known problems, usually unsupported stuff:

![svg importer log](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/14-import-warnings.png)

As the link in the log suggest, you can report [issues](https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/ez-curved-lines-2d/issues) on github; be sure to check if something is already listed.

Don't let that stop you, though, your future infinite zoomer and key-frame animator will love you for it:

![rat loves you](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/15-imported-rat.png)

# Manipulating shapes

The hints in the 2D viewport should have you covered, but this section lists all the operations available to you.

## Adding a point to a shape

Using double click you can add a point. Be aware that after adding the second point, you are expected to add new points __within__ the resulting polygon:

![add with double click again](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/04-double-click2.png)

## Bending a curve

Holding the mouse over line segment you can start dragging it to turn it into a curve.

![bend line](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/05-bend.png)

## Creating, mirroring and dragging control point handles

When you have new node you can drag out curve manipulation control points while holding the `Shift` button. The 2 control points will be mirrored for a symmetrical / round effect.

Dragging control point handles while holding `Shift` will keep them mirrored / round:

![mirrored handle manipulation](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/07-mirrored-handles.png)

Dragging them without holding shift will allow for unmirrored / shap corners:

![shar corner](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/08-sharp.png)

## Closing the loop and breaking the loop

Double clicking on the start node, or end node of an unclosed shape will close the loop.

Double clicking on the start-/endpoint again will break the loop back up:

![closed loop](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/09-loop.png)

You can recognise the start-/endpoint(s) by the infinity symbol: âˆž

## Using `closed` on `Line2D`

You do not always _need_ to close the `ScalableVectorShape2D` shape to draw a polygon, or a closed `Line2D`.


Setting the `closed` property on an assigned `Line2D` will display a dotted line over your shape:

![a closed line2d over an unclosed shape](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/11-line2d-closed.png) ![in the inspector](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/11a-line2d-closed.png)

## Deleting points and control points

You can delete points and control points by using right click.


## Setting the pivot of your shape

You can use the `Change pivot` mode to change the origin of your shape, just like you would a `Sprite2D`. In this case, the 'pivot' will actually be the `position` property of you `ScalableVectorShape2D` node.

This rat will want to rotate it's head elsewhere:

![set origin](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/16-set-origin.png)

Like this:

![set origin 2](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/16a-set_origin.png)

# Animating / Changing shapes at runtime

The shapes you create will work fine with basic key-frame operations. You can even detach the Line2D, Polygon2D and CollisionPolygon2D from `ScalableVectorShape2D` entirely, once you're done drawing and aligning. Moreover, you probably should in 95% of the cases

## Update curve at Runtime

Sometimes, however, you want your shape to change at runtime.

You can use the `Update Curve at Runtime` checkbox in the inspector to enable dynamic changing of your curved shapes at runtime.

![update curve at runtime](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/update-runtime.png)

## Add keyframes in an animation player

You can then add an `AnimationPlayer` node to your scene, create a new animation and create keyframes for your `Curve > Points` (in the inspector):

![animating](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/animating.png)

## Don't duplicate `ScalableVectorShape2D`, use the `path_changed` signal in stead

When the `update_curve_at_runtime` property is checked, every time the curve changes in your game the `path_changed` signal is emitted.

Duplicating a `ScalableVectorShape2D` will __not__ make a new `Curve2D`, but use a reference. This means line-segments will be calculated multiple times on one and the same curve! Very wasteful.

If however you want to, for instance, animate 100 blades of grass, just use __one__ `DrawableShape2D` and have the 100 `Line2D` node listen to the `path_changed` signal and overwrite their `points` property with the `PackedVector2Array` argument of your listener `func`:

![path_changed signal](./addons/curved_lines_2d/screenshots/10-path_changed-signal.png)


## Performance impact
Animating curve points at runtime does, however, impact performance of your game, because calculating segments is an expensive operation.

Also, the old [OpenGL / Compatibility](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/core_and_modules/internal_rendering_architecture.html#compatibility) rendering engine seems to perform noticably better for these operations in 2D than the [Vulkan / Forward+](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/core_and_modules/internal_rendering_architecture.html#forward) mode.

Under `Tesselation settings` you can lower `Max Stages` or bump up `Tolerance Degrees` to reduce curve smoothness and increase performance.


# Ye Olde `DrawablePath2D` Examples

Wondering where my beautiful rat, the leopard and butterfly net went?

I felt the installation started to become too cluttered, so I pruned them in this new release. Of course feel free to look them up in the [1.3.0.zip](https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/ez-curved-lines-2d/archive/refs/tags/1.3.0.zip) / [1.3.0 source](https://github.com/Teaching-myself-Godot/ez-curved-lines-2d/tree/1.3.0/addons/curved_lines_2d/examples)


# Attributions

Lot's of thanks go out to those who helped me out getting started:
- This plugin was first inspired by [Mark Hedberg's blog on rendering curves in Godot](https://www.hedberggames.com/blog/rendering-curves-in-godot).
- The suggestion to support both `Polygon2D` and `CollisionPolygon2D` was done by [GeminiSquishGames](https://github.com/GeminiSquishGames), who's pointers inspired me to go further
- The SVG Importer code was adapted from the script hosted on github in the [pixelriot/SVG2Godot](https://github.com/pixelriot/SVG2Godot) repository


# Wishlist / Roadmap

I tend to keep a personal list of checkboxes on the bottom of my readme's to help structure my milestones. Given time, space (and money??) I should start converting this into issues, or a CHANGELOG / RELEASE_NOTES. I guess

- [ ] Add button to editor to call center node position func
- [ ] Helper nodes for gradient from-, stop- and to-handles
- [ ] SVG Import log: add button to select node with problem
- [ ] SVG Import log: show/hide different log levels, clear log

## Would be nice (if I learn how to)
- [ ] New icon for ScalableVectorShape2D node
- [ ] Import `<text>` (with embedded fonts? reference to ttf with a dialog?)
- [ ] Arcs to cubic bezier curve conversion
- [ ] Gradient fills for Line2D strokes (would probably require a shader)
- [ ] Fix certain gradient transforms (skew, rotate, fx/fy/fr) [see: chair.svg](./addons/curved_lines_2d/tests/chair.svg)
- [ ] Pattern fills
- [ ] Undo/Redo SVG Import (Undo = delete SvgImport node)
